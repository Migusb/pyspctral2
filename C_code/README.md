# SPCTRAL2 C version (aka spectrl2)

Note that the C code has been modified slightly from the original (which can be found in 'spectrl2_2.tar')

* slight changes to the output format
* inputs of `{varname}` for the variables we want to change in the C code template via the wrapper
* curly braces doubled elsewhere `{{` in the C code to preserve them after the Python string formatting
